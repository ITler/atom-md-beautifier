## About
This tool collection allows modifying of HTML exported markdown files written in [github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
The supported workflow is saving the markdown's HTML representation from [Atom](https://atom.io)'s *markdown preview* to a HTML file.

Calling `beautify_atom_markdown.sh`
1. changes style implementation of the exported HTML
2. provide SSH based upload feature to a publishing location

## Caveats
* tool collection sparely tested - it does what I need it for
